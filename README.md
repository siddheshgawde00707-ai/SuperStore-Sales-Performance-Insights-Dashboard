Interactive Dashboard Creation: Designed a user-friendly Power BI dashboard to visualize key business metrics like total revenue, profit, and sales volume in one place.


1) Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Tracking: Implemented YoY analysis to compare this year’s performance against the same period last year, making it easy to see if the business is growing or shrinking.

2) Automated Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to clean and organize the raw data, ensuring all reports are based on accurate and consistent information.

3) Advanced DAX Measures: Created custom calculations (measures) to determine complex figures like profit margins and rolling averages.

4) Sales Trend Analysis: Built line charts that show sales trends over months and years, helping to identify seasonal peaks and slow periods.

5) Regional Performance Insights: Included a geographic breakdown to show which regions or cities are contributing the most to total sales.

6) Product Category Breakdown: Developed visualizations to identify top-selling products and categories, allowing for better inventory management.

7) Dynamic Filtering (Slicers): Added interactive filters so users can view data for specific time periods, regions, or product types with a single click.

8) Profitability Analysis: Analyzed the relationship between sales volume and net profit to identify high-margin opportunities.

9) Data Modeling: Established a "Star Schema" data model to connect different data tables (like Sales, Products, and Calendar) for fast and efficient reporting.
